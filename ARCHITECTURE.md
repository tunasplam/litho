# Litho — Architecture

A small, personal image annotation tool: open an image, draw polygons, text
boxes, highlights, freehand strokes, and lines/arrows on top of it, adjust
their color/size/opacity, and save/export back out (with format conversion
between PNG/JPG/BMP/etc.).

**Status snapshot** (update this line each session)
`2026-07-21` — Line, Arrow, and Double-arrow tools are live, on top of the
existing Highlighter/Select pipeline. One `LineItem` (canvas/items.py)
covers all three toolbar actions via a `head_style` flag (`"none"`,
`"end"`, `"both"`); `tools/line.py`'s `LineTool` is instantiated three
times in `main_window.py`, once per head style. You can open an image,
draw a highlight, a plain line, an arrow, or a double-headed arrow,
switch to Select, move any of them, and press Delete to remove it.
Polygon, Freehand, and Text-box actions remain present but disabled —
not implemented yet. Next step: pick one (`tools/freehand.py` is
probably the simplest — drag-to-draw path, no vertex/click-to-close
complexity) and repeat the pattern.

## 1. Goals / non-goals

**Goals**
- Fast to open, fast to annotate, fast to save. Single user, single machine.
- Small enough for one person to hold the whole codebase in their head.
- Runs on any general Linux distribution without dependency headaches.

**Non-goals** (explicitly out of scope, revisit only if a real need shows up)
- No layers panel, no multi-image tabs/workspaces, no plugin system.
- No cloud sync, accounts, or collaboration features.
- No raster editing (no brush/paint tools, filters, or pixel-level retouching)
  — this is an *annotation* tool over an existing image, not a paint program.
- No mobile/web build. Desktop Linux only.

Keeping this list visible is meant to stop scope creep as we go — if a
feature isn't on the toolbar mockup we agreed on, it needs a deliberate
decision to add, not a quiet drift.

## 2. Tech stack

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.13 | Fast to write/maintain; fast enough for this app's scale (rendering is the bottleneck, not Python itself). |
| GUI toolkit | PySide6 (Qt 6) | `QGraphicsView`/`QGraphicsScene` gives selectable, movable, resizable items almost for free — maps directly onto our tool set. LGPL, no licensing friction. |
| Env/deps | [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | Fast, single tool for venv + dependency management + running scripts. |
| Testing | `pytest` + `pytest-qt` | `qtbot` fixture simulates clicks/drags/keystrokes for tool tests; plain pytest for everything else. |
| Packaging (later) | PyInstaller or Nuitka | Bundles the interpreter + Qt libs into one standalone executable — no venv needed at runtime. Not needed until the app actually works. |

No dependencies are pinned yet beyond what `uv init` created. `PySide6` (and
`pytest-qt` as a dev dependency) get added when we start on the first
component that needs them.

---

## 3. Design principles

- **Items vs. Tools vs. Commands, kept separate.**
  - *Items* (`canvas/items.py`) are `QGraphicsItem` subclasses — they only
    know how to draw and resize themselves.
  - *Tools* (`tools/`) are small state machines that turn mouse events into
    item creation/edits. One file per tool.
  - *Commands* (`commands.py`) are `QUndoCommand` subclasses that wrap every
    mutation (add/move/resize/delete/edit-text), giving us undo/redo via
    Qt's `QUndoStack` instead of hand-rolled state snapshots.

  This split means adding a new tool later touches two small files instead
  of one large one, and undo/redo isn't bolted on after the fact.

- **`main_window.py` stays thin.** It builds the toolbar UI and forwards
  input to whichever tool is active. It should never need to know *how* a
  polygon gets drawn.

- **`io.py` is separate from `canvas/scene.py`.** Loading/saving/format
  conversion is a different concern from scene management and should be
  testable (and tweakable) on its own.

- **GUI tests run headless.** `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` lets the full Qt
  test suite run without a real display — same behavior on a desktop, over
  SSH, or in CI.

Target structure. Items marked `(scaffold)` already exist from `uv init`;
everything else is created as we build each component.

## 5. UI reference

Two toolbars, both docked at the top (see the interface mockup). No status
bar, no side panels.

**Row 1 — file / edit / zoom**
New · Open · Save · export format dropdown (PNG/JPG/BMP) · Undo · Redo ·
zoom out / percentage / zoom in / fit-to-window

**Row 2 — tools + contextual properties**
Select · Polygon · Line · Arrow · Double-arrow · Freehand · Highlighter ·
Text box — then, for whatever's currently selected: stroke color, fill
color, size (stroke width for shapes, font size for text), opacity.

Text boxes are edited in place: double-click to enter edit mode, click away
or Esc to commit.

---

## 6. Development workflow

```bash
uv sync                        # create/update the venv from pyproject.toml
uv run python -m litho         # run the app in dev mode
uv run pytest                  # run the test suite
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen uv run pytest   # run tests with no display attached
uv add PySide6                 # add a runtime dependency
uv add --dev pytest pytest-qt  # add a dev-only dependency
```

Each component gets built, manually run/tested via `uv run python -m
litho`, and committed on its own before moving to the next.

---

## 7. Component status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Project scaffold (`uv init`) | Done | Flat `main.py`, now a thin shim into `litho.__main__`. |
| Package skeleton (`litho/` package, `__main__.py`) | Done | |
| `main_window.py` + toolbars (no working tools yet) | Done | Text-only actions; both toolbar rows laid out and tested. Icons come later via `icons.py`. |
| `canvas/view.py` + `canvas/scene.py` | Done | Zoom in/out/fit-to-window; a minimal `_on_open` in `main_window.py` loads an image via `QFileDialog` + `QPixmap` so the canvas is exercisable before `io.py` exists. |
| `canvas/items.py` | Partial | `HighlightItem`, `LineItem`. Polygon/Text/Freehand items follow the same base pattern (subclass a standard `QGraphicsItem` type, get selection styling for free). |
| `tools/base.py` (`Tool`, `Style`) | Done | `Style` is the shared stroke/fill/size/opacity state tools read at creation time; `main_window.py` owns and mutates it. |
| `tools/select.py` | Done | Delegates to Qt's native item selection/move — just sets `RubberBandDrag` on activate. Delete/Backspace removes the selection (`CanvasView._delete_selected_items`). |
| `tools/polygon.py` | Not started | |
| `tools/line.py` | Done | One `LineTool`/`LineItem` pair, instantiated three times (Line/Arrow/Double-arrow) with different `head_style` values. |
| `tools/freehand.py` | Not started | |
| `tools/highlighter.py` | Done | Drag-to-draw `HighlightItem`; always translucent (`BASE_OPACITY = 0.4`) scaled further by the Opacity control — a highlighter that isn't translucent by default isn't very useful. |
| `tools/text.py` | Not started | |
| `commands.py` (undo/redo) | Not started | |
| `io.py` (open/save/convert) | Not started | |
| `icons.py` | Not started | |
| CLI image argument (`litho <path>`) | Done | `litho/__main__.py:parse_args`; `MainWindow(initial_image=...)` and `open_image_from_path()` shared with the Open action. |
| Test scaffold (`conftest.py`, fixtures) | Partial | `test_main_window.py` in place, using pytest-qt's built-in `qtbot`/`qapp` fixtures directly — no hand-rolled `conftest.py` needed yet. Will add one once tests need shared fixtures (e.g. sample images for `io.py`). |
| Packaging (PyInstaller/Nuitka) | Not started | Deferred until the app works end to end. |

## 8. Decisions log

- **2026-07-21** — Chose Python + PySide6 over C++/Qt and Rust+Slint.
  Reasoning: `QGraphicsView` gives selection/move/resize behavior for free,
  which matches this app's needs closely; prioritizes maintainability for a
  solo personal project over raw performance headroom we don't need at this
  scale.
- **2026-07-21** — Chose `uv` for environment/dependency management.
- **2026-07-21** — Will run from a venv during development (`uv run`); will
  package as a standalone binary via PyInstaller or Nuitka later, once the
  app is functionally complete. No Flatpak/AppImage — unnecessary overhead
  for software only one person runs.
- **2026-07-21** — Architecture split into Items / Tools / Commands (see
  §3) to keep files small and undo/redo consistent from the start.
- **2026-07-21** — UI is top-toolbar-only, no status bar, no side panels
  (see §5) — confirmed against the interface mockup.
- **2026-07-21** — `main.py` kept as a two-line shim into `litho.__main__`;
  both `uv run python main.py` and `uv run python -m litho` work.
- **2026-07-21** — No `[build-system]`/packaging metadata added to
  `pyproject.toml`. The app isn't meant to be `pip install`-ed — we're
  packaging as a standalone binary later (§2) — so instead
  `tool.pytest.ini_options.pythonpath = ["."]` lets pytest find the
  `litho/` package without installing it into the venv.
- **2026-07-21** — Tests use pytest-qt's built-in `qtbot`/`qapp` fixtures
  directly; no custom `conftest.py` yet. Run headless with
  `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`.
- **2026-07-21** — `main_window.py`'s Open action loads images directly via
  `QFileDialog` + `QPixmap` rather than waiting for `io.py`. This is
  temporary scaffolding to make the canvas testable now; `io.py` will take
  over open/save/format-conversion and this call site gets swapped over
  then.
- **2026-07-21** — Fixed a real GC bug in `CanvasView`: `QGraphicsView`
  does not take Python-side ownership of the scene passed to its
  constructor, so without an explicit `self._scene = scene` reference,
  PySide6 can garbage-collect the scene out from under the view once the
  caller's own reference goes out of scope. `main_window.py` happened to
  avoid this by keeping `self.scene` around, but it's now fixed at the
  source in `CanvasView` itself so nothing else can hit it.
- **2026-07-21** — Added `litho <path>` CLI support via `argparse` in
  `litho/__main__.py`. Image-loading logic was factored out of `_on_open`
  into `MainWindow.open_image_from_path()` so both the toolbar Open action
  and the CLI argument share one code path. No `[project.scripts]` entry
  point added yet — that's still `uv run python -m litho <path>` for now;
  a bare `litho <path>` command comes for free once we package a binary
  later (§2), since argv works the same way there.
- **2026-07-21** — Item classes subclass Qt's standard graphics items
  (`QGraphicsRectItem`, and later `QGraphicsPolygonItem`/`QGraphicsLineItem`/
  `QGraphicsPathItem`/`QGraphicsTextItem`) rather than a from-scratch
  `QGraphicsItem`. They draw their own selection indicator (the dashed
  outline) for free, which is most of what `tools/select.py` needed.
- **2026-07-21** — `SelectTool` does almost nothing itself: Qt's own
  `QGraphicsView`/`QGraphicsScene` already handle click-to-select,
  rubber-band multi-select, and drag-to-move once an item has
  `ItemIsSelectable`/`ItemIsMovable` set. The tool just puts the view in
  `RubberBandDrag` mode; `CanvasView` calls Qt's default mouse handling
  instead of a custom handler whenever `SelectTool` (or any future tool
  with `handles_own_events = False`) is active.
- **2026-07-21** — Introduced `tools/base.py:Style`, a small dataclass
  holding the current stroke/fill/size/opacity from the toolbar.
  `main_window.py` owns one instance and mutates it as the controls
  change; every tool gets a reference to the same object at construction,
  so a newly created item always picks up whatever's currently set
  without tools needing to know about `MainWindow` itself.
- **2026-07-21** — `HighlighterTool` applies a fixed `BASE_OPACITY = 0.4`
  multiplied by the toolbar's Opacity control, rather than using Opacity
  directly. A highlight at 100% opacity would fully obscure the image,
  which defeats the point of a highlighter — real highlighter pens are
  translucent by nature, so that's the default here too.
- **2026-07-21** — Delete/Backspace removes selected items, handled in
  `CanvasView.keyPressEvent` rather than as a toolbar action — matches how
  every other image/drawing tool does it, and keeps the toolbar from
  growing a button for something a key already does well.
- **2026-07-21** — One `LineItem`/`LineTool` pair covers Line, Arrow, and
  Double-arrow rather than three separate item/tool classes: they only
  differ in a `head_style` flag (`"none"`/`"end"`/`"both"`), and
  `main_window.py` just constructs `LineTool` three times with different
  arguments. `LineItem` subclasses `QGraphicsLineItem` for the free
  selection outline, then overrides `paint()` to add arrowhead triangles
  on top and `boundingRect()` to pad for them (only when a head is
  actually drawn, so plain lines don't get an oversized hit/repaint
  region for arrowheads they'll never have).

---

## 9. Open questions

- Exact keyboard shortcuts (delete selected item, escape to cancel an
  in-progress polygon, etc.) — decide while building `tools/`.
- Packaging specifics (PyInstaller vs. Nuitka, icon/desktop-file
  integration) — deferred until there's a working app to package.
